     * TODO:
     *   The goal of this class is to offer a single
     *   method of retrieving / updating data in the remote SQL
     *   database. We need to ensure one connection is used. The user
     *   will only be manipulating data for one purpose at a time, so only
     *   one connection is needed.
     *   
     *   We can go with the Singleton design pattern for this purpose, or simply
     *   go with a static-based approach. Not sure what I want to do yet.
     *   
     *   Still looking into the optimal method for connecting to an SQL DB, so this class
     *   is completely barren other than credentials at the moment. Also, for our class it won't
     *   matter, but in a production environment obviously we'd never handle authentication
     *   client-sided like this.
